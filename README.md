# Rewards

### Introducing, Rewards Browser for Android!

This is a specially enhanced browser to make your earning experience smooth. Earning rewards has never been easier!

### Important Notice: 
> Rewards v1.3.1 marks an end to active development of this software, means there will be no more new features available. Routine Maintenances may also be slow and rare (if any). This decision is due to the lack of time I have to work on this project. Anyone who is interested to maintain this project further, get in touch with me. <br><br>
Thank you to everyone for your continued support through all this time.

### Features

- This browser automatically detects your remaining tasks and completes them for you, even able to complete desktop tasks from a mobile device.

- It has isolated multi-account support so you are undetectable when using multiple accounts on one browser, and switching between accounts is just two clicks away.

- **Turbo Search** : This mode completes your searches multiple accounts at a time, even when you are not using the app. Also supports 15-minute search cooldowns.

- Only 3 megabytes in installation size , a lot more storage efficient than Edge. If you ever uninstall the app, you may keep the accounts for when you reinstall.

- Share temporary access for your bing account, to other devices without sharing your password! 

- You can also complete tasks manually on this browser, and it can simulate both mobile and desktop versions of edge for that purpose.
