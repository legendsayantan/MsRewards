# Rewards

### Introducing, Rewards Browser for Android!

This is a specially enhanced browser to make your earning experience smooth. Earning rewards has never been easier!

### Features

- This browser automatically detects your remaining tasks and completes them for you, even able to complete desktop tasks from a mobile device.

- It has isolated multi-account support so you are undetectable when using multiple accounts on one browser, and switching between accounts is just two clicks away.

- **Turbo Search** : This mode completes your searches multiple accounts at a time, even when you are not using the app. Also supports 15-minute search cooldowns.

- Only 3 megabytes in installation size , a lot more storage efficient than Edge. If you ever uninstall the app, you may keep the accounts for when you reinstall.

- Share temporary access for your bing account, to other devices without sharing your password! 

- You can also complete tasks manually on this browser, and it can simulate both mobile and desktop versions of edge for that purpose.
